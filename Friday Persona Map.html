    <h2>Task 2: Stakeholder Persona and Journey Mapping for Improvement Opportunities</h2>
    <p>The persona for whom we are developing our customer journey is detailed in the persona map illustrated in Table 2. After developing a detailed explanation of the character that we have built to be the individual customer, we specified the most relevant features that we thought could help us identify her pain points through the Empathy Map illustrated in Figure 9, in Appendix C.</p>

          Lydia experienced mental health challenges in a high socio-economic background.<br>
          The only child, no siblings, very attached to parents. Parents are the most loving and supportive, always receiving “princess treatment.” Just completed a bachelor's degree and has directly transitioned into a master's program with no work experience. Left family to move to Australia for pursuing education and dream of being independent.<br>
          She is also navigating the workplace for the first time, learning how to communicate with diverse colleagues. She seeks practical guidance to help her reach a fulfilling career path.

          Wants to prove that she can stand on her own and achieve her dreams without relying on their direct support.<br>
          Have a family of her own.<br>

          Self-discovery and finding courses for practical skills.<br>
          Difficulty in communicating her skills in a business context, as tertiary education hasn’t prepared her for this.<br>
          Constantly missing her family and feeling the pain of being away from them, especially since they are her greatest strength.<br>
          Lack of sleep and exhaustion from juggling the pressures of higher education and adapting to a new country and culture.<br>
          Managing life independently for the first time after a long period of support is a key challenge. Balancing studies, emotional well-being, and practical responsibilities is difficult.
